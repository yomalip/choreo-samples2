## Deploy Application

Please refer to the Choreo documentation under the [Develop a REST API](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-rest-api/#step-1-create-a-service-component-from-a-dockerfile) section to learn how to deploy the application.

### Use the following configuration when creating this component in Choreo:

- Build Preset: **Dockerfile**
- Dockerfile Path: `python-reading-list-rest-api/Dockerfile`
- Docker Context Path: `python-reading-list-rest-api`

The [endpoints.yaml](.choreo/endpoints.yaml) file contains the endpoint configurations that are used by the Choreo to expose the service.

## Execute the Sample Locally
